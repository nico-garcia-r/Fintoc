## How to use this module

1. You must previously obtain the link_token of the links that have connected to your Fintoc account. Queries on the links that are made from the module will always return the link_token with Null value, so you can not get the link_token of a link that has already been connected. These link_token can only be obtained once, if the link_token is lost, you must reconnect the link with your Fintoc account. 
2. In order to connect, you will need to consult your Secret key from the API Keys section of your Fintoc account.
